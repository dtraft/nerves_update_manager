# ReflectOS Update Manager

## About

ReflectOS is the approachable, configurable, and extensible OS for your smart mirror project.  It is designed to allow anyone to easily install, customize, and enjoy a smart mirror/display - no coding or command line usage required!  Instructions for installing on your device and more details about ReflectOS can be found on the [ReflectOS Firmware](https://github.com/Reflect-OS/firmware) project.

This package provides the base functionality for allowing ReflectOS
to update itself "over the air", without having to take out the microSD
card.

If you are interested in building your own extensions for ReflectOS, 
please see the documentation for the [ReflectOS Kernel](https://hexdocs.pm/reflect_os_kernel) library.
